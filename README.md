# ECE209AS-AI-ML_CPS-IoT
Project for ECE 209-AS for Winter 2021

We are currently working on a project where we aim to implement object detection using microcontrollers. Broadly speaking, we aim to implement deep learning models such as RNNs and CNNs on memory-constrained devices like microcontroller (Arduino Nano specifically) and use them to facilitate object detection. Given below are some papers that we would refer to.
